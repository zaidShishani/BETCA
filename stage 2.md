| IDE  | Visual Studio Code | PyCharm |
| Operating System | Linux | Windows | 
| Version-control platform | GitHub | GitLab | 


I will give a brief description for each tool from each category then I will say why I choice the tools 

* IDE

1. Visual Studio Code: is source code made by microsoft with built in git elements and it allows us to customize it with  the ability to install extension.

Some of the advantages and disadvantage:

| Advantages | Disadvantage |
| --- | ----------- |
| Built in git  | Barely any debugging features |
| free | Need to install alot of extension and plugins to have it working fully  |
| Low resource requirement  |  |

2. pyCharm: is a programming environment for programmers made by programmers with little to no built in programmers where it have high customizability with over 3000 extension. 

Some of the advantages and disadvantage:
| Advantages | Disadvantage |
| --- | ----------- |
| Easy installation  | Heavy on resource requirement  |
| Code compilation feature  | pyCharm community is forced on python so most of the focus is on that language  |
| A lot of extension   | Can be very expensive and the free version is ot very good |

* Operating System

1. Linux: is an open software operating system where the code can be change for the user needs also it is free.

Some of the advantages and disadvantage:

| Supported by many hardwareds | Not open source code of the system  |


* Version-control platform

1. GitHub: Is website where you can save your code to an online repository where it is saved on teh clode where you can share your code updated and let other change it if you want and pull updated code from it.

Some of the advantages and disadvantage:
| Advantages | Disadvantage |
| --- | ----------- |
| HeaOne of the best open-sources systems der | Bad API development  |
| Simple to set up | Not good private reporestoy system  |
| Simple to share with people  | Not many features  |

2. GitLab: Is essentially the same as github but they differ in the service where it focus on the more private repository for teams and not open source code.

Some of the advantages and disadvantage:
| Advantages | Disadvantage |
| --- | ----------- |
| Consistent features updated  | Bad updating system  |
| Help to easily maintain code  | Lots of bugs |
| Great private repository system  | Not used by many people  |

* IDE: Visual Studio Code (VScode)
I choose VScode for it being 0$ also with it's built in git and where it doesn't consume as much as pyCharm from my memory where I can just install extensions to make it a complete for me needs also pyCharm costs like 200$ a year the only thing I be missing out one is a debugger which I wouldn’t use either way.

* Operating System: Windows
I’ll be using windows since it has more applications and I only need ubuntu’s terminal to work from Linux which I have downloaded from the microsoft play store giving me access to the ubuntu’s terminal commands and functionality best of both worlds easy of use and a lot of appalachian from windows and the terminals from ubuntu to help me get the best results.

* Version-control platform : GitHub
We'll be working on GitHub since I will be working on a team of 5 and the team is already familiar with GitHub . It is the obvious answer since it is easier to set up and easy sharing with easy control features.
